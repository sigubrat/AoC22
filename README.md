Some answers to the Advent of Code calender, made by a guy who has completely forgotten how python works

## PS! 
I've been using VSCode to run the code most of the time. 
If you're running the code from a terminal, you might have to change the file path when reading input files. 

For example:

```py
with open("day_1/data.txt", "r") as f:
```

should be 

```py
with open("data.txt", "r") as f:
```

I might re-structure data so that it's stored in a more convenient way at some point if I get really bored
